Hello, my name is Luis Torres and I am a software developer who is constantly learning. I like to write about my findings on my journey through blog posts as it gives me the opportunity to put my thoughts on virtual "paper". If someone happens to find any of my articles useful then all the better!

I originally was writing my blogs on [Medium](https://medium.com/), but there were some features/lack of features I didn't like about it, worst of all being that there is no option for dark mode. I am currently in the process of migrating all of my most informative articles to this site, so bare with me until then!
